# Alexandre Nunes - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi, I'm Alex! 

I'm learning full-time while my workplace is closed for renovations. I hope to turn this time into a career shift in the data analysis field.

My long-term goal is to work in a role that blends data with culture/history, ideally as a digital archivist or analyst in the GLAM sector (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums). This repository is where I plan to document what I learn: hands-on projects, skill development, and week-by-week learning logs.

This is my main portfolio hub and will be updated as I go.

## Current Focus for Month 1 – December 2025

Laying the foundation for everything else:

- Excel and Google Sheets: formulas, filters, basic charts
- SQL: querying, filtering, sorting, joins
- Practicing analytical thinking with realistic albeit sometimes fictional datasets
- Getting comfortable with GitHub, documentation, and doing mini-projects

You can find these entries in the [`/learning-log`](./learning-log/) folder.

## About Me

Before data, I was working in hotel front desk management — handling logistics, solving problems, working directly with guests and identifying trends for optimization/improvements. Now I'm focused on becoming a strong data analyst and eventually working with organizations that preserve and share culture. My priority right now is building real skills, creating useful projects, and learning how to think like an analyst to land an entry level position.

Thanks for checking out my work!
